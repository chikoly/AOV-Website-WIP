				<div><p>While many, many formats have been run and continue to be run on AOV, these are our most common ones. An important thing to note is that for the first two formats listed here, the aim is not to win, it's to create a fun story that everyone gets to be involved in.</p></div>

				<div class="big"><p><u>Standard Improv</u></p></div>
				<p>The most common format on AOV, it’s the closest to how the original games’ trials play out. It features the two standard benches, Defense and Prosecution, usually a detective, and usually two witnesses. Each witness and the detective give a testimony and the Defense asks questions and tries to spot a contradiction so they can OBJECT! The Prosecution’s objective is to try to shut down any bad theories or questions from the Defense and make rebuttals to points they bring up. Remember, a guilty isn’t always a bad thing here, as long as it’s a natural conclusion.</p>

				<div class="big"><p><u>Ace Attorney Investigation</u></p></div>
				<p>AAI is a format based off the Ace Attorney: Investigations games, where you take the role of an investigator who attempts to figure out the truth behind the crime. This format while it shares similarities with regular cases has several notable differences. There’s no judge, so it’s up to the Detective to decide if an investigator gets penalised for mistakes, and witnesses don’t give testimonies, but rather they have topics instead, providing the investigator with options to allow the questioning to go smoother. Along with these witnesses can use a variety of gimmicks such as psyche locks or logic chess. Finally, there are rivals whose goal is to impede your progress and provide counter arguments after you’ve questioned a witness. They aren’t as present as a prosecutor would be during a case, but the investigation may end if you cannot make a rebuttal. An investigation end when you find the truth or fail to find the truth, leaving you with a ‘’result’’ rather than a verdict.</p>

				<div class="big"><p><u>Class Trial</u></p></div>
				<p>The format that's closest to the Danganronpa Class Trials. Each player is given a character document by the Case Manager giving their various accounts of what they did and their truth bullets. Truth bullets are information that can be fired at any time so the other players can discuss it. One player is given a document matching the blackened, I.E. the person who actually did it. Their goal is to avoid having the crime pinned on them and misleading the rest of the players. After a certain amount of time passes, Monokuma, or whoever is presiding over the trial, will force the players to vote for who the Blackened is, and they better hope they get it right.</p>

				<div class="big"><p><u>Decision Game</u></p></div>
				<p>The format loosely based on the third game in the 999 series, Zero Time Dilemma. In this format, players attempt to outwit Zero's Decision Game, since most of the choices would result in death, or something else that'd be painful for the character. Like Class Trials, every player is given a character document, and that player must try to act as their character would. In some cases, a character may also infact be Zero, or an accomplice. This format is a lot more story heavy and GM reliant than the others listed.</p>
