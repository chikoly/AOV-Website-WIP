				<div><p>Our Server, Attorney Online Vidya, was started in late 2015. Over the years there’s been quite a few administration changes, some for the possibly for the better, some possibly for the worse, but we’re still going strong. We’re a primarily 4chan related community but the most important aspect of our community is we want to have fun so if you’re looking to have a good case that doesn’t have to be 100% serious, you’ll be able to find it here. We're also pretty heavy on community submitted content, as one could probably notice from our polling and suggestions docs, if you've got something you want to submit, have at it.</p></div>
